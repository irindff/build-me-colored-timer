# Build me a timer
You are provided a `Box` component that accepts a `color` prop, that colors the background of the box. You are not allowed to change that component.

Create your own component, `Text`, that accepts a `color` prop and a `text` prop and renders a `p` tag with this text and color.

Hook both of these color props to the input below, and create a toggle button that will switch the display between the box and text.

Finally, both components should reset the timer when they replace each other. the `Box` should move it every 1 second, and the `Text` should move it every 0.5 second. **Remember you are not allowed to change the Box component!**

## Instructions

* Run `yarn install` 
* Run `yarn start`
